#### 👋 Hello! 
I'm Dawid, a self-taught full stack developer from Poland passionate about building web applications and using Python in everyday life.

#### 🌱 Currently, I am learning:
- Advanced Python/OOP
- Best practices
- TDD and testing

#### 💻 About me
My journey in software development started a few years ago with Arduino, where I utilized my electronics knowledge. However, I soon discovered my growing passion for coding. During my Electrical Engineering program at Cracow University of Technology, I encountered coding again, this time with C++. Delving deep into complex concepts and deriving great satisfaction from it, I decided to pursue programming as a career. 
Along the way, I completed various online courses, including CS50x and CS50's Web Programming, to enhance my understanding of computer science. However, I have learned the most through hands-on experience and building my own projects.

#### 🚀 Projects
One of my notable projects is "Communicator," a full-stack chat application inspired by Facebook Messenger. Feel free to explore its repository, read the detailed README, and even try out the demo.

#### 🌍 Hobbies
When I'm not immersed in coding, you can find me fixing electronics or enjoying the outdoors, exploring hiking trails and growing food.

#### 📫 Let's connect! 
I'm always open to collaborating, contributing, and expanding my skills.
