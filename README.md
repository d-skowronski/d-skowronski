#### 💡 About me
My journey in software development started a few years ago with Arduino, where I utilized my electronics knowledge. However, I soon discovered my growing passion for coding. During my Electrical Engineering program at Cracow University of Technology, I encountered coding again, this time with C++. Delving deep into complex concepts and deriving great satisfaction from it, I decided to pursue programming as a career. 
Along the way, I completed various online courses, including CS50x and CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript, to enhance my understanding of computer science. However, I have learned the most through hands-on experience and building my own projects.

#### 🚀 Projects
One of my notable projects is "Communicator," a full-stack chat application inspired by Facebook Messenger. Feel free to explore its repository, read the detailed README, and even try out the demo.

#### 🌍 Hobbies
When I'm not immersed in coding, you can find me fixing electronics or enjoying the outdoors, exploring hiking trails and growing food.

I'm always open to collaborating, contributing, and expanding my skills.
